Vim C extension syntax files for various libraries, mostly GTK+-related.

Version 2025-08-11

=====[ Usage ]==================================================================================

1. Copy the contents of directory syntax to your $HOME/.vim/after/syntax
   (or copy just selected files).

2. Include selected files in your $HOME/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim like this:

   runtime! syntax/glib.vim
   runtime! syntax/gdkpixbuf.vim
   runtime! syntax/gtk3.vim
   runtime! syntax/pango.vim
   runtime! syntax/cairo.vim

=====[ Rebuilding/updating ]====================================================================

Most syntax files are generated from gobject-introspection GIR files using src/gir-vim-syntax.py.
Run generate.sh to rebuild the contents of syntax/. Modify GIR_PATH in generate.sh if your GIR
files are not in /usr/share/gir-1.0.

NB: generate.sh deletes entire syntax/ and creates it afresh!

Missing GIRs are OK. You will just not get the corresponding Vim syntax files.

Manually added symbols missing in introspection are in extras/. They are automatically added to
the corresponding vim file (based on file name).

A few additional manually created syntax files are in hand-crafted/. They are copied to syntax/
verbatim by generate.sh.

=====[ License ]================================================================================

The scripts are public domain. I do not think plain lists of symbols can be copyrighted (if you
are an Oracle lawyer, or Oracle anyone for that matter, go fuck yourself).
